Use Level of Detail (LoD): If you have objects that are far away from the camera, you can use a lower detail version of the object to save on processing power. This is especially useful for complex 3D models.

Frustum Culling: Don't render objects that are outside of the camera's view. You can achieve this by checking if the object's bounding box is inside the camera's frustum before rendering it.

Occlusion Culling: Don't render objects that are hidden behind other objects. This can be more complex to implement, but there are libraries and techniques available to help with this.

Use mipmaps for textures: Mipmaps are pre-calculated, optimized sequences of textures, each of which is a progressively lower resolution representation of the same image. They can increase rendering speed and reduce aliasing effects.

Reduce Overdraw: Overdraw happens when the same pixel is drawn to more than once per frame. You can reduce overdraw by sorting transparent objects back-to-front, opaque objects front-to-back, or using a depth buffer.

Batch Draw Calls: Try to draw similar objects together to reduce the number of draw calls. This can be achieved by using texture atlases (where multiple textures are packed into one single texture) or batching objects that use the same material together.
